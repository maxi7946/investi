I've successfully implemented Google OAuth login functionality for your application. Here's what was accomplished:

## Server-Side Changes:
- **Installed required packages**: `passport`, `passport-google-oauth20`, and `dotenv`
- **Added Google OAuth strategy** with Passport.js to handle authentication
- **Created OAuth routes**: `/auth/google` for initiating login and `/auth/google/callback` for handling the response
- **Implemented user creation**: Automatically creates new users from Google profile data if they don't exist
- **Added environment configuration**: Created `.env` file with placeholders for Google OAuth credentials

## Client-Side Changes:
- **Updated login component**: Modified the Google login button to redirect to the OAuth endpoint
- **Added OAuth callback handling**: The login page now checks for OAuth success parameters and automatically logs users in
- **Integrated with existing auth context**: Uses the same authentication flow as regular login

## Key Features:
- **Seamless integration**: Google login works alongside existing email/password authentication
- **Automatic user creation**: New Google users are automatically registered with verified email status
- **Role-based navigation**: Redirects users to appropriate dashboards based on their role
- **Secure token handling**: Uses JWT tokens consistent with the existing authentication system

## Setup Instructions:
To complete the setup, you'll need to:

1. **Get Google OAuth credentials**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable Google+ API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Set authorized redirect URI to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`

2. **Update environment variables** in `server/.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret
   ```

The application is now running with both servers active (backend on port 3000, frontend on port 5174). Users can click the Google login button to authenticate with their Google account. The system will handle user creation, login, and navigation automatically.
